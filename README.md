# -JavaScript-and-DOM-Manipulation
A Dynamic HTML Table
Instructions
Part I
Use HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript to render a dynamically created table containing the data in addressData.js. It should look something like this. For now, don't worry about creating a search field.

Part II
If you've finished populating the table rows, implement a search function (by state) into your page.

You may use the filter() method that you've learned, or alternatively, an if statement.

Bonus
If you finish Parts I and II, try to implement a multiple search function, e.g. the ability to search by state and city.
